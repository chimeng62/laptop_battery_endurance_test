## Areas for Improvement

### ðŸš€ High Priority - Critical Issues

#### 1. Process Management (CRITICAL)
- **Force Kill Processes**: Replace graceful app closing with task manager-style process termination
  - Use `psutil.Process().terminate()` or `subprocess` with `taskkill` on Windows
  - Prevents hanging on "Save changes?" dialogs or unresponsive applications
  - Add process tracking to kill specific browser/Office instances opened by the test
  - Implement timeout-based forced termination (e.g., try graceful close for 5s, then force kill)

#### 2. Test Reliability & Robustness  
- **Application State Management**: 
  - Track PIDs of opened applications for reliable cleanup
  - Handle "application already running" scenarios (multiple browser instances)
  - Add application crash detection and restart capability
- **Error Recovery**: 
  - Implement try-catch blocks around each test phase
  - Continue testing even if one component fails
  - Add retry mechanisms for failed operations

#### 3. Immediate Code Fixes
- **Remove Hardcoded Delays**: Replace `time.sleep()` with smart waiting
- **Centralize Logging**: Fix duplicate logging configuration across files
- **Add Process Cleanup**: Ensure all test-opened processes are terminated between cycles

#### 3. User Experience
- **Real-time Dashboard**: Create GUI or web interface for monitoring
- **Progress Indicators**: Show test progress and estimated remaining time
- **Automatic Result Calculation**: Eliminate manual timestamp input
- **Test Interruption Handling**: Graceful shutdown and resume capabilities

### ðŸ”§ Medium Priority - User Experience

#### 4. Process Management Improvements
- **Smart Process Detection**: Identify which browser/Office processes belong to the test
- **Clean State Management**: Ensure clean application state between test cycles
- **Resource Monitoring**: Track memory/CPU usage of test applications

#### 5. Configuration & Flexibility
- **Configuration Files**: Move URLs, file paths, timing to config files
- **Test Customization**: Allow users to modify test duration, websites, Office files
- **Platform-Specific Optimizations**: Better handling of Windows vs macOS differences

#### 6. Basic Analytics
- **Auto Result Calculation**: Eliminate manual timestamp entry
- **Simple Reporting**: Generate basic battery performance summary
- **Test History**: Keep track of previous test results

### ðŸ”® Future Enhancements

#### 7. Advanced Features
- **GUI Interface**: Real-time monitoring dashboard
- **Database Integration**: Store and analyze historical results  
- **Enhanced Workloads**: GPU testing, gaming scenarios
- **Temperature/Performance Monitoring**: Track thermal throttling effects

## âœ… Phase 1 Achievements & Current Implementation
