## Core Functionality

### 1. Test Orchestration (`test.py`)
- **Entry Point**: Main module that coordinates all test activities
- **Configuration**: Handles command-line arguments (YouTube disable option)
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging system with timestamps
- **Platform Detection**: Cross-platform support (Windows/macOS)
- **Infinite Loop**: Continuous test execution until battery depletion

### 2. Battery Monitoring (`utils/battery_utils.py`)
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Uses `psutil` to track battery percentage
- **Power State Detection**: Monitors plugged/unplugged status
- **Logging Integration**: Timestamps battery levels throughout test

### 3. Test Components

#### Browser Test (`test_cases/browser_test.py`)
- Opens 5 predefined news/tech websites
- Simulates user interaction with mouse movements and clicks
- Performs scrolling actions on each page
- Cross-platform keyboard shortcut handling

#### Office Test (`test_cases/office_test.py`)
- Automates Microsoft Office applications (Word, Excel, PowerPoint)
- Opens and interacts with test documents
- Simulates realistic office workflows

#### YouTube Test (`test_cases/youtube_test.py`)
- Video playback simulation for media consumption testing
- Optional component (can be disabled via command-line)

### 4. Time Analysis (`datetime_calculator.py`)
- Post-test analysis tool for calculating total battery runtime
- Converts timestamps from log files to readable duration
- Provides formatted output (HH:MM:SS)

## Current Strengths

1. **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on Windows 11 and macOS 12+
2. **Realistic Workload Simulation**: Mimics actual office usage patterns
3. **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed timestamp logging for accurate measurements
4. **Modular Design**: Well-organized code structure with separate test modules
5. **Standardized Testing**: Provides checklist for consistent test conditions
6. **Robust Error Handling**: Disables PyAutoGUI failsafe for uninterrupted testing

## Areas for Improvement

### ðŸš€ High Priority - Critical Issues

#### 1. Process Management (CRITICAL)
- **Force Kill Processes**: Replace graceful app closing with task manager-style process termination
  - Use `psutil.Process().terminate()` or `subprocess` with `taskkill` on Windows
  - Prevents hanging on "Save changes?" dialogs or unresponsive applications
  - Add process tracking to kill specific browser/Office instances opened by the test
  - Implement timeout-based forced termination (e.g., try graceful close for 5s, then force kill)

#### 2. Test Reliability & Robustness  
- **Application State Management**: 
  - Track PIDs of opened applications for reliable cleanup
  - Handle "application already running" scenarios (multiple browser instances)
  - Add application crash detection and restart capability
- **Error Recovery**: 
  - Implement try-catch blocks around each test phase
  - Continue testing even if one component fails
  - Add retry mechanisms for failed operations

#### 3. Immediate Code Fixes
- **Remove Hardcoded Delays**: Replace `time.sleep()` with smart waiting
- **Centralize Logging**: Fix duplicate logging configuration across files
- **Add Process Cleanup**: Ensure all test-opened processes are terminated between cycles

#### 3. User Experience
- **Real-time Dashboard**: Create GUI or web interface for monitoring
- **Progress Indicators**: Show test progress and estimated remaining time
- **Automatic Result Calculation**: Eliminate manual timestamp input
- **Test Interruption Handling**: Graceful shutdown and resume capabilities

### ðŸ”§ Medium Priority - User Experience

#### 4. Process Management Improvements
- **Smart Process Detection**: Identify which browser/Office processes belong to the test
- **Clean State Management**: Ensure clean application state between test cycles
- **Resource Monitoring**: Track memory/CPU usage of test applications

#### 5. Configuration & Flexibility
- **Configuration Files**: Move URLs, file paths, timing to config files
- **Test Customization**: Allow users to modify test duration, websites, Office files
- **Platform-Specific Optimizations**: Better handling of Windows vs macOS differences

#### 6. Basic Analytics
- **Auto Result Calculation**: Eliminate manual timestamp entry
- **Simple Reporting**: Generate basic battery performance summary
- **Test History**: Keep track of previous test results

### ðŸ”® Future Enhancements

#### 7. Advanced Features
- **GUI Interface**: Real-time monitoring dashboard
- **Database Integration**: Store and analyze historical results  
- **Enhanced Workloads**: GPU testing, gaming scenarios
- **Temperature/Performance Monitoring**: Track thermal throttling effects

## Technical Debt & Code Issues

### Immediate Fixes Needed

1. **Process Hanging Issue (CRITICAL)**: Applications get stuck on confirmation dialogs
   ```python
   # Current problematic approach:
   pyautogui.hotkey('alt', 'f4')  # May trigger "Save changes?" dialog
   
   # Recommended solution:
   import psutil
   import subprocess
   
   def force_kill_process(process_name):
       for proc in psutil.process_iter(['pid', 'name']):
           if process_name.lower() in proc.info['name'].lower():
               proc.terminate()  # or proc.kill() for immediate termination
   
   # Or use system commands:
   subprocess.run(['taskkill', '/f', '/im', 'msedge.exe'], shell=True)  # Windows
   subprocess.run(['pkill', '-f', 'Safari'], shell=True)  # macOS
   ```

2. **Duplicate Logging Configuration**: Remove repeated logging setup in multiple files
3. **No Process Tracking**: Need to track PIDs of opened applications for cleanup
4. **Error Prone Sleep Statements**: Replace with robust waiting mechanisms  
5. **Missing Error Handling**: Add try-catch blocks around each test operation

### Security Considerations

1. **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs, especially file paths
2. **Privilege Escalation**: Minimize required permissions
3. **Safe File Operations**: Add file existence checks and proper exception handling
4. **Network Security**: Validate URLs and implement secure browsing

## Development Workflow Suggestions
